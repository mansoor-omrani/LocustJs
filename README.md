# LocustJs
A personal library containing various utilities. I am in fact a C# developer. I created this library based on previous experience in web application projects. I had various code snippets here and there in different web projects. I wanted to gather all of them at one point and stop copy-pasting the same code. I also wanted to be able to better maintain the utilities I wrote. So, the idea of LocustJs came to my mind. LocustJs is an independent javascript library. It does not rely on any other library or framework (except for its extensions). As my front-end skill is fairly limited, no typescript, ECMAScript2015, 2016, 2017 is currently used in writing LocustJs. I wrote it in pure javascript (no modules, classes, closures and other modern javascript stuff). But I plan to upgrade it. I hope you enjoy this library. I am open to contributions and suggestions.
