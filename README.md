# LocustJs
An independent javascript library containing various helpful utilities.

I am a C# developer. I created this library based on previous experiences and coding in ASP.NET web application projects.

I had various code snippets here and there. I wanted to gather them all at one point and stop copy-pasting.

I also wanted to better maintain the utilities. So, the idea of LocustJs came to my mind.

LocustJs is an independent javascript library. It does not rely on any other library or framework (except for its extensions like Locust.jQuery.Extend.js).

As my front-end skill is fairly limited, no typescript, ECMAScript2015, 2016, 2017 is currently used in writing LocustJs.

I wrote it in pure javascript (no modules, classes, closures and other modern javascript stuff). But I plan to upgrade it.

I wrote most of the parts from scratch by myself and borrowed some parts from various websites, discussions, forums, etc. For those borrowed code snippets I mentioned the source link.

Currently I have not documented LocustJs. Well. I am not the only guilty one regarding documentation. So do all developers and programmers! But I promise. I will write documentations in the near future.

I hope you enjoy this library. I am open to contributions and suggestions.
